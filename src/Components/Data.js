    Beautiful Humankind, 

    “Will catch up in 15 mins on the roof top.” He said and hung up the call.

    “Do you even realise how late you are? Every time you do the same.” She screamed.

    With her folded arms trying to ignore him she turned right.

    I don’t dream wedding today,
    I dream education,
    I dream a happy family 
    Happiness,
    Independence and confidence,
    5 years down the lane
    I dream to be the person
    I’ve dreamt today
    Oh, not so big thoughts
    A little down to earth behaviour,
    kindness
    And spreading love
    I dream to be proud,
    of myself.`,

    In the middle of a silent night,
    When you feel your world falling apart,
    When even for a fraction of seconds,
    You feel messed.
    And lost,
    When you feel you haven’t achieved enough.
    Or, “I don’t know what am I upto.”
    When such feelings wrap you around,
    Like a fuzzy blanket
    I want you to know
    Little dove,
    Cry a little if you want.
    Go for a walk.
    Read.
    Listen to your favourite music,
    Do anything,
    But let that feeling shore away,
    Because I tell you,
    That feeling is miserable.
    And you’d not like to taste it.`,
